# Eye Sync

## About 
Eye Sync is a project built to participate along at Teknisa Software's first internal Hackaton. This project was intended to collect user's pictures and use an AI to create a bond between a user's buying habits and their physical caracteristics. At first, user's shouldn't be identified. We would estimate their buying habits using a statistical media. We use AWS Rekognition to acquire the information needed from a picture, not neededing to identify a user.

## Demo 

You can check our results [here](https://thiguet.github.io/eye_sync/dist/#/home). Using AWS Rekognition System we were able to get users info by their pictures, such as age range, and others.
